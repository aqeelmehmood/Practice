covariance:Direction btata hy two variable me
correlation:strength btata hy mgr kitny strength hy wo nahi btata

Rregression:
            x=age,weight,height,Family Disease,Monthly Income,Transportation,Married,Nature of Job
            Y=Diabetes

            kisi by Variable ka correlation nikaly gy Diabetes ky sath kitny strength hy

Linear Regression:
                            (x,y)
                            (2,1)
                             (4,7)

y=mx+c slope intercept form two point form  y-y1/y2-y1=x-x1/x2-x1

two intercept form x/a + y/b

slope=m=gradiant=tan@=weight=rise/run=y/x

Straight Line Slope =m=y2-y1/x2-x1(at Every Point Slope Same aega)
